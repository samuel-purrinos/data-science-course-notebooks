# Machine Learning Course Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks used in the [Complete 2022 Data Science & Machine Learning Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/python-data-science-machine-learning-bootcamp/) course on Udemy, instructed by Philipp Muellauer and Dr. Angela Yu.

Each notebook is organized in a separate folder, with its corresponding dataset, and covers a specific topic in machine learning. The notebooks are written in Python and R and include code examples, visualizations, and explanations of machine learning concepts.
